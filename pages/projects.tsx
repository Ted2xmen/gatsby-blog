          I mostly use <span className="text-slate-300">Next.js</span> for my
          web development projects. For styling, I use various libraries, but I
          tend to rely on Styled Components,
          <span className="text-purple-700"> Tailwind</span>, and Ant Design. I
          enjoy using <span className="text-blue-600">TypeScript</span> for type
          safety and better code organization.

          As for content management systems, I have worked with Strapi and
          Contentful before. I also have experience with
          <span className="text-yellow-600"> Firebase</span> and React Native
          for mobile app development.

          In the future, I am interested in learning

          use in various fields.
